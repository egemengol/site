# CSS Grid Layout: A Beginner's Guide

CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that revolutionizes how we create web layouts. Unlike Flexbox, which works primarily in one dimension, Grid allows you to control both rows and columns simultaneously.

## Why Use CSS Grid?

- **Simplicity**: Create complex layouts with minimal code
- **Flexibility**: Easily responsive without media queries
- **Control**: Precise placement of elements

## Basic Grid Container

Start by defining a grid container and specifying your columns:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```
