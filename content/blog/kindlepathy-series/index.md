Want to read a 500-chapter web novel on your Kindle? Good luck.

Before Kindlepathy supported series, you had two options: 
- **suffer through the Kindle browser** on each chapter (terrible)
- **write code to scrape the entire thing** and convert it with Calibreâ€”a tedious process I knew all too well.

Both sucked. The browser experience was painful, and the scraping approach meant rebuilding the entire book every time new chapters came out.

Ongoing series? Forget about it.

**Now it's stupid-simple.** Paste the link to chapter 1. Read it. Hit "Next" when you're done.

The next chapter appears, perfectly formatted. 

That's it.

How? It intelligently finds the "Next Chapter" link on the page. All you have to do is keep reading.

No more copy-pasting dozens of URLs. No more rebuilding books in Calibre.

**It works with ongoing series too.** That 1000+ chapter *One Piece* manga? Readable. That web novel that updates weekly? The next chapter is just there when you hit "Next." No more checking for updates.
