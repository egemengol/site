I love my kindle and want to ***read web content*** (mainly blogposts alongside some grayscale manga) on it.

You could go directly to the ***website itself***. Not all websites are kindle-browser friendly, entering the page url by hand is not fun, sometimes you need to authenticate to access content.

You could make the ***posts into books*** via calibre or some online service. Reading experience is excellent, but you pollute your library with many small books. Sending those books is not instant as well.

**Kindlepathy** is in the middle. Once you open the [kindlepathy.com/read](https://kindlepathy.com/read) page on your kindle, that is all you need to do to read your articles. 

Using your PC or phone, you control which article you want to read next.

You can put the article url into the box over there, to let Kindlepathy download that article for you.

Some contents are require you to be authenticated, so there is a PC browser extension, that sends the current webpage as an article to Kindlepathy, for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kindlepathy-extractor) and [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eclacjdfoacbmgoiongjpmlaangpmbac)
